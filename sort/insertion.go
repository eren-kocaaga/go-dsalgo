// InsertionSort The idea of swapping adjacent elements to sort a list of items
// can also be used to implement the insertion sort. In the insertion sort
// algorithm, we assume that a certain portion of the list has already been
// sorted, while the other portion remains unsorted. With this assumption,
// we move through the unsorted portion of the list, picking one element at
// a time. With this element, we go through the sorted portion of the list
// and insert it in the right order so that the sorted portion of the list
// remains sorted./*
